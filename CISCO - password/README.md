# Write-up
Enable Secret Can’t be decrypt.
Instead I decrypted Cisco 7 Password of Admin & Console
Using **findmyhash** in kali linux
And I found pattern in passwords are as follows :
Admin password is : **6sK0_admin**
Console Password is : **6sK0_Console**
so First Five Character in password are same **6sK0_**
Just Enter after that enable for **enable** password that’s it.
